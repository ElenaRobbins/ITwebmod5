I used a tool called WAVE to check my real estate homepage for accessibility. It found some images without explanations (alt text), so I added descriptions to them. It also saw that some buttons had colors that were hard to see, so I made the backgrounds darker and the text lighter to make them easier to read.

Lighthouse, another tool, showed that all form fields now have labels, and I used proper HTML parts like <main>, <nav>, and <footer> to organize the page. You can move around the site using the keyboard, and I added special markers (ARIA landmarks) for future improvements. After fixing everything, the site scored perfect 100% for accessibility, making it better for people using screen readers or with visual impairments.
