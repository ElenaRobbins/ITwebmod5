I checked the ESPN website on both a computer and a phone to see how easy it is for everyone to use. The site has good parts for screen readers, like special labels and clear sections. But some images don’t have descriptions (alt text), which helps people who can't see pictures. Also, some things you click on, like live scores, aren’t always easy to use with just the keyboard.

On the phone, the site adjusts well to small screens. However, some buttons are tiny and close together, making it hard for people with motor difficulties to tap them. The colors are generally easy to read, but some text over images isn’t very clear. Overall, ESPN is doing a good job with accessibility, but they could improve in adding descriptions to images and making sure all parts can be used with the keyboard.
